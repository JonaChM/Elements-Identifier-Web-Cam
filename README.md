# Elements-Identifier-Web-Cam
Element identifier on real time credits to the Youtuber SalteeKiller for the knowledge of this uses of the library on a real time project.
This is similar to the previous project but in this case we're using the webcam and the code on a while loop for constant reading, at the end it will give you a list with the different elements recognized by the program.
In order to change the camera used for the detection you can play with the camera used on the VideoCapture method that uses as argument the number of the camera in case you have more than the default webcam.
It's not perfect but you can have fun with it.
